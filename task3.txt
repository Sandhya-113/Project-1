This test case assumes the `HelloWorld` program is modified to return its output as a parameter. If your COBOL environment doesn't support such testing, you can manually verify the output by running the program and comparing the result.

Sandhya-113: give test case for the above program

GitHub Copilot: Here is a simple test case for the provided COBOL program. Since COBOL does not have built-in unit testing frameworks, you can simulate a test by redirecting the program's output to a file and comparing it with the expected output.
